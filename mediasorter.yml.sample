    # Search overrides
    # Useful if you have some search term that sortfile is generating which does not work reliably.
    # Use this dictionary, where the key is whatever sortfile generates, and the value is what you
    # want to search instead, to override the actual search with another one.
    # For example, "S.W.A.T." (TV show) ends up searching "s w a t" which matches another show, so
    # you can use this example entry to override that.
    # Add your own as needed; this list is populated by my own findings. PRs to add to this list
    # are also welcome if you find shows or movies affected.
    # NOTE: Movies are joined by "+" before this list is checked, so use + in place of spaces here.
    search_overrides:
      "s w a t": "swat"
      "law and order": "law & order"

    # Name overrides
    # Useful if there is a show you want to "rename" to a different name than what the metadata
    # providers return. For instance, a purist might want "Start Trek: The Original Series" instead
    # of the returned "Star Trek". Separated by media type (tv or movie) to avoid cross-changes.
    name_overrides:
      tv:
        "Star Trek": "Star Trek: The Original Series"
